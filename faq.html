        <h3>Who created this site?</h3>
        <p>The <span class="color-text">Monthly Prompt</span> competition was created by <span class="color-text">Eric Davidson</span>, a software engineer that spends most of his time working on a myriad of side projects. You can contact Eric by email at <span class="color-text">thebuffed@gmail.com</span>.
        <h3>How do I know that my donation is being used appropriately?</h3>
        <p>Great question and one I want to be <span class="color-text">extremely transparent</span> about. Each month I will do my best to share any analytics from PayPal regarding the <span class="color-text">number of donations</span> for that month. I want it to be clear that your donations are supporting the site and going towards the monthly cash prize.</p>
        <h3>How are the stories judged?</h3>
        <p>Right now I will be evaluating all of the submissions on my own. The hope is that the number of entries will <span class="color-text">surpass my ability</span> to receive them by myself and I will be able to enlist help.</p>
        <p>Eventually I would like to <span class="color-text">involve the community</span> with some kind of voting system. For example, I may choose between five and ten entries for a particular month and then readers would vote on their favorites. This method will <span class="color-text">provide more exposure</span> and incentive for participation. Things are simple right now at the beginning but with your help they will become much more exciting quickly!</p>
        <h3>Do I retain the rights to my stories?</h3>
        <p>Of course! I will never use the stories submitted to <span class="color-text">monthlyprompt@gmail.com</span> for any reason other than to promote the site and the author that submitted the story.</p>
        <h3>What should I include in my submission?</h3>
        <p>For the subject of your email, please identify the month that you're submitting for as well as the <span class="color-text">title of your submission</span>. In addition to your story, please include any information or links that you would like included should your story be chosen and displayed on the site.</p>
        <h3>Why is the website so simple and boring?</h3>
        <p>Right now I am trying to find out how much <span class="color-text">interest people have</span> in this concept. Given enough time, participants, and donations the site and competition will evolve accordingly.</p>
        <h3>Can I become a sponsor?</h3>
        <p>Yes, and that <span class="color-text">would be amazing</span>! Send me an email at <span class="color-text">thebuffed@gmail.com</span> so that we can discuss further.</p>
