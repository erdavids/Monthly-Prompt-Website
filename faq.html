        <h3>Who created this site?</h3>
        <p>The <span class="color-text">Monthly Prompt</span> competition was created by <span class="color-text">Eric Davidson</span>, a software engineer that spends most of his time working on a myriad of side projects. You can contact Eric by email at <span class="color-text">thebuffed@gmail.com</span>.
        <h3>How do I know that my donation is being used appropriately?</h3>
        <p>Great question and one I want to be <span class="color-text">extremely transparent</span> about. Each month I will do my best to share any analytics from PayPal regarding the <span class="color-text">number of donations</span> for that month throught the newsletter. You can <a href="https://tinyletter.com/MonthlyPrompt" target="_blank">click here</a> to subscribe. I want it to be clear that your donations are supporting the site and going towards the monthly cash prize.</p>
        <h3>How are the stories judged?</h3>
        <p>Right now I will be evaluating all of the submissions on my own. The hope is that the number of entries will <span class="color-text">surpass my ability</span> to receive them by myself and I will be able to enlist help.</p>
        <p>Eventually I would like to <span class="color-text">involve the community</span> with some kind of voting system. For example, I may choose between five and ten entries for a particular month and then readers would vote on their favorites. This method will <span class="color-text">provide more exposure</span> and incentive for participation. Things are simple right now at the beginning but with your help they will become much more exciting quickly!</p>
        <h3>Are there any guidelines on the types of stories?</h3>
        <p>There are no real restrictions regarding form, but you will have a better chance of winning the competition if you avoid disturbing and offensive material.</p>
        <h3>Do I retain the rights to my stories?</h3>
        <p>Of course! I will never use the stories submitted to <span class="color-text">monthlyprompt@gmail.com</span> for any reason other than to promote the site and the author that submitted the story.</p>
        <p>Please take a look at the <span class="color-text">terms of service</span> below for more information</p>
        <h3>What should I include in my submission?</h3>
        <p>For the subject of your email, please identify the month that you're submitting for as well as the <span class="color-text">title of your submission</span>. In addition to your story, please include any information or links that you would like included should your story be chosen and displayed on the site. You are also welcome to submit anonymously, but if you only want your writing displayed you must make that clear in your submission email.</p>
        <h3>Why is the website so simple and boring?</h3>
        <p>Right now I am trying to find out how much <span class="color-text">interest people have</span> in this concept. Given enough time, participants, and donations the site and competition will evolve accordingly.</p>
        <h3>Can I become a sponsor?</h3>
        <p>Yes, and that <span class="color-text">would be amazing</span>! Send me an email at <span class="color-text">thebuffed@gmail.com</span> so that we can discuss further.</p>
