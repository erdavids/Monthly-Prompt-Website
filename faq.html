        <h3>Who created this site?</h3>
        <p>The Monthly Prompt competition was created by Eric Davidson, a software engineer that spends most of his time working on a myriad of side projects. You can contact Eric by email at thebuffed@gmail.com.
        <h3>How do I know that my donation is being used appropriately?</h3>
        <p>Great question and one I want to be extremely transparent about. Each month I will do my best to share any analytics I can from PayPal regarding the number of donations for that month. I want it to be clear that your donations are supporting the site and going towards the monthly cash prize.</p>
        <h3>How are the stories judged?</h3>
        <p>Right now I will be evaluating all of the submissions on my own. The hope is that the number of entries will surpass my ability to receive them by myself and I will be able to enlist help.</p>
        <p>Eventually I would like to involve the community with some kind of voting system. For example, I may choose between five and ten entries for a particular month and then readers would vote on their favorites. This method will provide more exposure and incentive for participation. Things are simple right now at the beginning but with your help they will become much more exciting quickly!</p>
        <h3>Do I retain the rights to my stories?</h3>
        <p>Of course! I will never use the stories submitted to monthylprompt@gmail.com for any reason other than to promote the site and the author that submitted the story.</p>
        <h3>What should I include in my submission?</h3>
        <p>For the subject of your email, please identify the month that you're submitting for as well as the title of your submission. In addition to your story, please include any information or links that you would like included should your story be chosen and displayed on the site.</p>
        <h3>Why is the website so simple and boring?</h3>
        <p>Right now I am trying to find out how much interest people have in this concept. Given enough time, participants, and donations the site and competition will evolve accordingly.</p>
        <h3>Can I become a sponsor?</h3>
        <p>That would be amazing! Send me an email at thebuffed@gmail.com so that we can discuss further.</p>
